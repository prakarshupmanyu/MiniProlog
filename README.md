# MiniProlog
A system infers new information from given statements in first order logic.

A creative and detailed problem statement is provided in Problem-statement.pdf. The python implementation is in file homework.py in the folder 'Python Answer'. I also manually created some test cases to verify my code and test some corner cases. They are in the same directories with the names as case1.txt, case2.txt, etc. The expected output of a test case file is stored in another file (in the same directory) by the name of output_<name_of_test_case_file>. For example, expected output of case11.txt is stored in output_case11.txt.

Instead to running these cases individually, you can just run pu_test.sh file, which internally executes runScript.sh. You might have to make small path related changes in order to run it.
